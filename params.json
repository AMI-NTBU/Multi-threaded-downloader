{"name":"Multi-threaded-downloader","tagline":"A multi threaded downloaded made in nodejs","body":"###Multi-threaded-downloader\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a multi threaded downloader which is made in nodejs. It is highly configurable and extremely efficient.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n1. Supports virtually unlimited number of threads.\r\n2. Supports restarting of failed downloads (Downloads only the parts that were not downloaded).\r\n3. Supports checksum verification of file download.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n----------\r\n1. Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) (skip if already done).\r\n2. Install mt-downloader globally.\r\n\r\n\t```bash\r\n\tnpm install -g mt-downloader\r\n\t```\r\n3. Start using eg.\r\n\r\n\t```bash\r\n\tmtd -u \"http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/mirror/videolan/vlc/2.0.6/macosx/vlc-2.0.6.dmg\" -f \"vlc-2.0.6.dmg\"\r\n\t```\r\n\r\nNote: I face issues while installing as the 'wordwrap' package doesnt get installed on its own. In case you also face the same issue install wordwrap globally.\r\n\r\n\t```bash\r\n\tnpm install -g wordwrap\r\n\t```\r\n\r\nUpcoming features!\r\n-------------------\r\n1. Have a user interface.\r\n\r\n2. Have different video download algorithms to boost up video download performance.\r\n\r\n3. Work as a proxy with video sites such as youtube so that buffering is completely removed.\r\n\r\n4. Will be able to restart abruptly terminated threads.\r\n\r\n5. Able to install through node package manager.\r\n\r\n6. Supports partial downloads for eg - downloading from 30 to 70% of the complete file.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
